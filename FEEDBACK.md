## Why a test?
To build trust.

## How long to spend on the test?
As a [general rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb), I don't want to spend more than 10 hours bidding on something. OR In this case a coding test. I have had a good time interviewing with Sandvik so let's where this goes.

## What is most interesting about a test?

So far understand that GUID and UUID are the same.

That this:
```
for b in `seq 1000`;do cat ~/go/src/sandvik_test/crap | rush 'curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/{} > /dev/null';done
```
Would create some sort of hiccup found a good test! Also turn on Prometheus.
